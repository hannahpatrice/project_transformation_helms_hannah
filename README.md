##Resources
I did not use any resources outside of the lectures and my notes on this assignment.

##Deductions
I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

##Comments
I went back and reviewed the in-class project similar to this. I could not figure out why my footer wouldn't stay at the bottom like it did in that project without using clear:both; even though the project explicitly told us not to use clears. I'm interested to know how to do this otherwise.
